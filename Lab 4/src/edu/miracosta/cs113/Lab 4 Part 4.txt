// The overall loops run some n(n-1)/2 times but the actual interior
// of the loop only runs once per exterior loop, which runs n-1 times
// due to the fact that it starts at 1 and goes while less than n
// Therefore, the inner part of the loops runs n-1 times

// Final result is a linear relationship of magnitude N

// Program is O(N)
